I’ll keep this one short and sweet, and just say this: The most important feature that your software can have is that it’s in the hands of end users. That’s where features are truly fleshed out through actual use.

Although I disagree with some of the points in the article, I can’t say it any better than Jamie Zawinski as quoted by Joel Spolsky in [The Duct Tape Programmer](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html) (interesting article, about 5 minutes to read): “**But that’s not the point — you’re not here to write code; you’re here to ship products.**”

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

Idea for the day: remember [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain%27t_gonna_need_it) (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)
