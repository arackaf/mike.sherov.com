While I found almost every tip in the book to be useful, I found one tip to stand out from the rest, considering it pointed out one of my particularly bad habits: “Write clear code, not clever code”.</p>\n<p>One of my passions as a programmer is figuring out new and better ways to do the same thing. I love refactoring code and finding out what was being done in 10 lines, I could do in 3. Or as a better measure, doing something with one if else block instead of a triply nested if else statement. Usually this works out great. The code is simpler to maintain, and less complex for all involved.</p>\n<p>However, in my endless pursuit of smaller, clearer code, I would often end up with smaller, more confusing code. In 2009, as a member of a 7 person agile team, it was very easy to measure how I was doing in this category: How often did another team member ask me what a piece of code did? Once I began looking at these problematic blocks of code, I noticed a pattern, and began to work on resolving the problem. It doesn’t matter what my particular problem was… what mattered was that I began looking for it!</p>\n<p><strong>Pay attention to your team members.</strong> Look into why they’re asking you about your code. Maybe there is something you do that makes perfect sense to you, but could be written clearer. <strong>Consider the next person who’s going to be looking at your code.</strong> Chances are, they’ll be happier looking at clearer code, not clever code. You’ll be happier too.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Writing Clear Code, Not Clever Code","date":"April 15, 2012","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/clear-code/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/shipping-is-your-primary-feature/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Shipping is Your Primary Feature"}}}}}
