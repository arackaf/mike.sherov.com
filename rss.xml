You know, the type of language used by the clueless recruiter trying to communicate a challenging role. “This company is looking to hire a real ninja.” Or “rock star developer”. Or “10x developer”. It’s obvious to me that both “ninja” and “rock star” are embarrassingly aggressive and brogrammy terms to apply to the craft of software development, but “10x” seems like it’s worthy of a second look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10x the Features?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its roots, those who ridicule the concept of a 10x developer are interpreting 10x to mean 10x the amount of features or code. “Yeah, right, 10x! More like 10x the technical debt”. Seems like that joke at its heart is an insult to both the developer who thinks their only measure is their code output, and whoever that poor sap’s manager is, who’s actively using LOC or feature output as the only measure of success. That’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what I’m defending. If you work somewhere where your only measure is feature output, quit yesterday. By all means. For the rest of us who have competent managers who view us holistically…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10x the Impact?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common attempt at deriding the 10x developer concept goes like this: “Really, it just happens to be that senior staff get chosen to work on more important stuff than juniors, and therefore, 10x devs don’t exist as much as 10x projects do”. This is certainly true, at least to some level at all companies. However, again, if you work in an org where there isn’t enough important work for everyone, and only the senior team can do the work, quit two days ago. &lt;strong&gt;The codebase should be well tested so you can practice collective ownership&lt;/strong&gt; and business should get its priorities straight so that there aren’t wild discrepancies in importance for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10x the What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m not talking about LOC (or any other braindead metric for measuring software “output”), and I’m not talking impact, then 10x what? What is the 10x developer 10x better at than her colleagues? Quite simply: raising the effectiveness of those who sit around her. &lt;strong&gt;A true 10x developer helps her teammates accomplish their goals.&lt;/strong&gt; A 10x developer takes the time to communicate challenges and solutions she encountered during the day so that her teammates may learn something new. A 10x dev gives thorough code reviews, talks face to face with the submitter of each PR to discuss best practices. A 10x dev makes tools the rest of the team uses. The joke I’ve heard to describe the 10x dev goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a 10x dev, make 5 2x devs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a 10x dev, it’s on you to make sure you’re working somewhere that can see it, nurture it, and get you on the road to being a 100x dev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you measure yourself, or worse, if your boss measures you by features built or LOC, quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the seniors get all the glory because they’re the only heroes who get to work on high impact stuff, quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re surrounded by 2x developers, chances are you’re a 10x developer. Make sure you work somewhere that recognizes that.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shipping is Your Primary Feature]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ll keep this one short and sweet, and just say this: The most important feature that your software can have is that it’s in the hands of…]]></description><link>http://mike.sherov.com//shipping-is-your-primary-feature/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://mike.sherov.com//shipping-is-your-primary-feature/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep this one short and sweet, and just say this: The most important feature that your software can have is that it’s in the hands of end users. That’s where features are truly fleshed out through actual use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I disagree with some of the points in the article, I can’t say it any better than Jamie Zawinski as quoted by Joel Spolsky in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html&quot;&gt;The Duct Tape Programmer&lt;/a&gt; (interesting article, about 5 minutes to read): “&lt;strong&gt;But that’s not the point — you’re not here to write code; you’re here to ship products.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;salted duck eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idea for the day: remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain%27t_gonna_need_it&quot;&gt;YAGNI&lt;/a&gt; (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Writing Clear Code, Not Clever Code]]></title><description><![CDATA[In Practices of an Agile Developer, Andy Hunt and Venkat Subramaniam outline a huge list of ways to improve yourself as a software developer…]]></description><link>http://mike.sherov.com//clear-code/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://mike.sherov.com//clear-code/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Apr 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/097451408X&quot;&gt;Practices of an Agile Developer&lt;/a&gt;, Andy Hunt and Venkat Subramaniam outline a huge list of ways to improve yourself as a software developer. While I found almost every tip in the book to be useful, I found one tip to stand out from the rest, considering it pointed out one of my particularly bad habits: “Write clear code, not clever code”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my passions as a programmer is figuring out new and better ways to do the same thing. I love refactoring code and finding out what was being done in 10 lines, I could do in 3. Or as a better measure, doing something with one if else block instead of a triply nested if else statement. Usually this works out great. The code is simpler to maintain, and less complex for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in my endless pursuit of smaller, clearer code, I would often end up with smaller, more confusing code. In 2009, as a member of a 7 person agile team, it was very easy to measure how I was doing in this category: How often did another team member ask me what a piece of code did? Once I began looking at these problematic blocks of code, I noticed a pattern, and began to work on resolving the problem. It doesn’t matter what my particular problem was… what mattered was that I began looking for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to your team members.&lt;/strong&gt; Look into why they’re asking you about your code. Maybe there is something you do that makes perfect sense to you, but could be written clearer. &lt;strong&gt;Consider the next person who’s going to be looking at your code.&lt;/strong&gt; Chances are, they’ll be happier looking at clearer code, not clever code. You’ll be happier too.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
